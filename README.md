Ever thought about owning an Airbnb? I have! Using Airbnb data from the internet, I conducted an analysis to answer two key questions:  

1. **What are the key factors driving the nightly rental price for units in the Austin area?**  
2. **What are the key factors influencing the likelihood of keeping a unit consistently booked in the Austin area?**  

In addition to answering these questions, I used this project as an opportunity to practice exploratory data analysis (EDA), including cleaning the dataset and handling a significant amount of missing values. 
The results of the analysis are summarized in the decision tree I created. To maximize the likelihood of having your apartment or home booked, the key factors are:

1. Offering at least one private room.  
2. Providing space for up to, but no more than, 9 people.  
3. Setting a nightly price of less than $90.  

These insights highlight practical steps for optimizing your Airbnb listing!
